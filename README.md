# Simon--Game
A fun memory challenge game inspired by Simon Says, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Simon Says Game
​A simple but fun memory game built with a focus on core web technologies. Test your memory by repeating the color sequence generated by the game.
​Game Rules
​The game is straightforward. When a new level begins, the game will flash a sequence of colors. Your job is to remember the sequence and click the buttons in the exact same order.
​To Start: Press any key on your keyboard or click the "CLICK HERE" text.
​Gameplay: The game will show a single color flash for level 1, then two for level 2, and so on.
​Scoring: Your score is the number of levels you successfully complete.
​Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game ends. You can restart by pressing any key again.
​Technologies Used
​This game was built using the fundamentals of web development:
​HTML: For structuring the game interface, including the title, score, and colored buttons.
​CSS: For all the styling, including the button shapes, colors, and the flash animations when a button is clicked or selected by the game.
​JavaScript: The core logic of the game is handled here, from generating the random color sequence and tracking user input to managing levels, scores, and the "game over" state.
